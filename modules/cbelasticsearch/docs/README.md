# Elasticsearch for the Coldbox Platform

The CBElasticsearch module for the Coldbox Platform provides you with a fluent API for managing and searching Elasticsearch indices.

In addition, CBElasticsearch also provides:

* a CacheBox Cache provider
* a Logbox Appender
* a migrations manager for [CFMigrations](https://forgebox.io/view/cfmigrations)

Each of these rely on Wirebox DSL mappings and require additional Wirebox configuration to use them outside of a Coldbox context.
